## 📌 Assignment 1  
**Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations  
- Takes two numbers as input from the user.  
- Performs the following operations:  
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division  
- Displays the result of each operation clearly on the screen.  

**File:** `Assignment_1/task_1.py`


### Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting  
- Takes first name and last name as input from the user.  
- Concatenates them into a full name.  
- Prints a personalized greeting message with the full name.  

**File:** `Assignment_1/task_2.py`

## 📌 Assignment 2  
**Module 3: Control Structures in Python**

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd  
- Takes an integer input from the user.  
- Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.  
- Displays the result accordingly.  

**File:** `Assignment_2/task_1.py`

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop  
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.  
- Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.  
- Displays the final sum.  

**File:** `Assignment_2/task_2.py`

## 📌 Assignment 3  
**Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function  
- Defines a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a number.  
- Uses a loop or recursion to compute the factorial.  
- Returns the result and prints it when called.  

**File:** `Assignment_3/task_1.py`

### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations  
- Asks the user for a number.  
- Uses the `math` module to calculate:  
  - Square root of the number  
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)  
  - Sine of the number (in radians)  
- Displays the calculated results clearly.  

**File:** `Assignment_3/task_2.py`

## 📌 Assignment 4  
**Module 5: Files, Exceptions & Errors in Python**

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors  
- Reads content from `sample.txt` line by line using `readlines()`.  
- Displays the content with line numbers.  
- Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.  

**File:** `Assignment_4/task_1.py`

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File  
- Takes user input and writes it to a file `output.txt`.  
- Appends additional user input to the same file.  
- Reads and displays the final content of the file.  

**File:** `Assignment_4/task_2.py`

## 📌 Assignment 5  
**Module 6: Data Structures & Strings in Python**

### Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks  
- Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and marks are values.  
- Takes a student's name as input.  
- Retrieves and displays the marks if the name exists.  
- If not found, displays an appropriate message.  

**File:** `Assignment_5/task_1.py`

### Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing  
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.  
- Extracts the first five elements.  
- Reverses the extracted list (using `.reverse()` or slicing).  
- Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.  

**File:** `Assignment_5/task_2.py`
